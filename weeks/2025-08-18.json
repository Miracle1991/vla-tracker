This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

          "abstract_zh": "近年来，从网络规模的机器人数据集中学习的通用视觉表示取得了巨大的成功，使得机器人能够在操作任务上进行数据高效的学习；然而这些预先训练的表示大多是在 2D 图像上，忽略了世界固有的 3D 性质。然而，由于大规模 3D 数据的稀缺，从网络数据集中提取通用的 3D 表示仍然很困难。相反，我们正在寻找一种通用的视觉预训练框架，作为替代方案，它可以改善所有 3D 表示。我们的框架称为 FVP，是一种新颖的 4D 视觉预训练框架，用于现实世界的机器人学习。FVP 将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，将预测模型建模为扩散模型，并直接在更大的公共数据集上预训练模型。在 12 个现实世界的操作任务中，FVP 将这些任务的 3D 扩散策略 (DP3) 的平均成功率提高了 28%。经过 FVP 预训练的 DP3 在模仿学习方法中实现了最先进的性能。此外，FVP 的功效适用于各种点云编码器和数据集。最后，我们将 FVP 应用于更大的视觉-语言-动作机器人模型 RDT-1B，增强其在各种机器人任务上的性能。我们的项目页面位于：https://4d-visual-pretraining.github.io/"
